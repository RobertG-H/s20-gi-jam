## The Game

Rabbits. On a train. A classic. How did we get here? More importantly, are we there yet? In “Rail Tale”, all these questions are asked but not answered. In “Rail Tale”, join up to 4 of your friends in an online multiplayer game where you have one objective: make it to Connecticut on the weirdest train ever built. But it’s not that easy; the train has multiple components that break over time. Fix them by playing a variety of wacky mini games so that you can connect!
